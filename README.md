# Awesome Visual Agent

**A curated research index for visual agents that perceive, ground, plan, act, create, and evaluate in visually grounded environments.**

Visual agents occupy the intersection of multimodal perception, grounded reasoning, tool use, interaction, and control. This repository curates papers, benchmarks, datasets, runtimes, and engineering resources for systems that close the loop between visual observation and purposeful action.

The list is selective rather than exhaustive. It prioritizes works that introduce a clear agent loop, action space, evaluation protocol, data engine, safety finding, or reusable implementation artifact, while excluding generic multimodal models and one-shot visual-generation systems without an agentic mechanism.

## Curation Rubric

An item should usually satisfy at least one of these conditions:

- It defines a new visual-agent capability, benchmark, data engine, training recipe, runtime, or safety evaluation.
- It evaluates closed-loop behavior rather than only static recognition or one-shot generation.
- It is widely used as a baseline, benchmark, dataset, environment, or builder tool.
- It has a stable paper, official code, project page, or documentation that readers can inspect.

An item is removed or left out when the visual-agent connection is weak, the link is unverifiable, the arXiv ID is wrong, the row duplicates a better entry, or the contribution is mostly a product announcement without enough technical detail.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome when they improve precision rather than volume.

Recommended metadata:

- The paper title or project name.
- Official paper, code, project page, or documentation link.
- The best category for the item.
- One sentence explaining the visual-agent loop, benchmark role, or builder value.

Out of scope:

- Generic multimodal model releases with no visual-agent evaluation.
- One-shot generation papers without planning, tools, search, critique, or interaction.
- Duplicate benchmark rows unless the new row adds a distinct environment or protocol.
- Unverified arXiv IDs, placeholder links, and marketing-only announcements.

## Maintenance Policy

This repository is maintained as a precision-oriented research map:

- Prefer primary sources: official papers, project pages, code repositories, datasets, benchmarks, and technical documentation.
- Keep research entries, benchmarks, and engineering resources separated when their roles differ.
- Add recent work only when it improves the conceptual coverage, empirical coverage, or builder utility of the map.
- Verify arXiv identifiers, project links, and benchmark names before adding new entries.
- Prune duplicate, weakly scoped, or marketing-only entries even when they are recent.
- Preserve a strict visual-agent boundary: perception alone is not sufficient without grounding, planning, tool use, interaction, control, or agent-oriented evaluation.
